# Meteorologist

## Passive Set the Stage:

Meteorologist can see how many and what types of interactibles are on a stage. The stage determines what rarity of chest she can see the items of (Solid common boxes, Liquid green boxes, Air Red Boxes,  Plasma Lunarpods, void cradles, gambling, etc etc) and changes her abilities effects.

Thoughts: Maybe also have interval radar scanning or when she purchases a chest of the stage? (How to keep radar scanner still useful though...) Maybe also make it unique to each stage? This can break for additional stage mods/updates unless we have a default and is waaay too much work to do for the abilities.

## Quick Key:

Solid: Titanic Plains, Siphoned Forest, Rallypoint Delta, Sundered Grove, (If modded stages or unlucky, always get this form unlocked by Stage 2)

Liquid: Verdant Falls, Abandoned Aqueduct, Wetland Aspect, Sulfur Pools, (If modded stages or unlucky, always get this form unlocked by Stage 3)

Air: Distant Roost, Aphelian Sanctuary, Scorched Acres, Siren's Call (If modded stages or unlucky, always get this form unlocked by Stage 4)

Plasma: Abyssal Depths, Sky Meadow, Gilded Coast, Void Fields+ (If modded stages or unlucky, always get this form unlocked by Stage 5)

## Primary: Meteorologist expels matter that she forms from her current state

Solid Hailstone: Throw hail which stuns smaller enemies (Has an arc and rolls slightly before breaking)

Liquid Cloudburst: Charge up a ball of water which blasts outward knocking enemies back and giving you a buff that heals you a very small amount (Close to medium range)

Air Piercing Gust: Fires out quick bursts of air which can headshot (Long range no falloff)

Plasma Luminous Crack: Creates a whip of plasma that overheats. (Close range but further than most melees (Kinda like pathfinders? + a little more))


## Secondary: Meteorologist summons matter that manipulates enemies directly ~ 5 second cooldown

Solid HailStorm: Target a location and form a Hailcore which ruthlessly explodes. Enemies caught within it are frozen and explode into small glacial blasts when killed.  

Liquid RainStorm: Instantly cast a wave of water which pulls enemies toward you while weakening them. (Meant to let you land a big hit with the primary)

Air WindStorm: Quickly launch a ball of wind in a direction. The first enemy it collides with activates it, sucking up nearby enemies into the air holding them in place while dealing damage overtime for 3 seconds. (Easy headshots)

Plasma SolarStorm: Cause overheated enemies to explode and get dragged toward you by a gravity orb (Grandparent ball)


## Utility: Meteorlogist morphs into her states form to do cool stuff ~ 7 second cooldown

Solid Swath: Turn into an avalanche and slide forward creating a path of slippery ice behind you which allows your hail to slide for longer and deal more damage (builds up like snow ball)

Liquid Runoff: Turn into a wave of water which pulls enemies with you and pushes them out in front of you after the duration ends. Can be arced (stuns and give you invincibility (A buff!))

Air Advection: 2 Charges. Turn into air and quickly dash in ANY direction leaving a small current which pulls small enemies in for 1 second.

Plasma Discharge: Crack your whip in a direction which stops on the first object/enemy hit (has range). On hit, turn into plasma becoming apart of your whip and rush directly into the hit surface creating an explosion which stuns and overheats

Alt Utils Concept?: Create different clones of your self that support you and your allies


## Special: Cycle through forms from previous stages. Changing forms grants a temporary buff and has a passive benefit. cooldown based on amount of forms (0, 12, 8, 4) second cooldown

Solid Tectonic shift: Gain a temporary 50 armor and freeze nearby enemies. Passive benefit: Gain 20 armor and are immune to freeze

Liquid Condensate: Cleanse yourself instantly and heal for each nearby enemy hit. Passive benefit: Gain 0.25 health regen for every buff you have and you are immune to slowing effects

Air Cyclone: Launch yourself into the air dealing damage to nearby enemies. Passive benefit: Gain 2.5% movespeed for every critical hit for up to 25% movespeed and you can glide/float

Plasma Borealis: Crash into the ground creating a Solar Flare on impact. Size and tick rate scales with speed. Passive Benefit: Gain 1% attackspeed for every unit that has Overheat for up to 25% and you take less damage from overheat. (Allies take less damage from her solare flare)


## Notes:

Her base stats are extemely low. Her armor starts at -5, her health regen at 0.8s (instead of the normal 1s in rainstorm), 0.5 m/s slower walkspeed (same sprint speed as other survivors though), and 0.8 attackspeed. This is offset by her ability to hard focus the items she wants on a stage and her ability to switch forms
